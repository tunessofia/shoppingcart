a poc simulating a beer store. For support has a dummy backend. 

Requirements:
- List all the beers on the store.
- When we click buy on a beer it should be added to the cart
- When we add beers to the cart it should stack all the beer types
- On the beer cart we should be able to add or remove them if  we want
- The total price should be adjusted as we add or remove on the cart
- when we click Checkout we should go to another view that lists the beers and prices.

Done using:

- Saga
- Webpack
- Jest
- Enzyme
